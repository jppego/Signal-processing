# Signal processing
ECG signal waveform and FFT feature extraction for diagnostic prediction

# Introduction 
This project was delivered for the "Signal Processing" module of the course unit "Fundamentals of Data Science and Engineering" of the Master in Data Science and Engineering.
It was a group project, which required from us to extract features of a signal in time and frequency spaces. 

We chose the publicly available electrocardiography dataset [PTB-XL](https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/1.0.1/). The dataset comprises **21837 clinical 12-lead ECG records of 10 seconds length from 18885 patients**, where 52% are male and 48% are female with ages covering the whole range from 0 to 95 years (median 62 and interquantile range of 22). The value of the dataset results from the comprehensive collection of many different co-occurring pathologies, but also from a large proportion of healthy control samples. The waveform files are stored in WaveForm DataBase (WFDB) format with 16 bit precision at a resolution of 1μV/LSB and a sampling frequency of 500Hz (records500/). For the user’s convenience we also release a downsampled versions of the waveform data at a sampling frequency of 100Hz (records100/).
